--Version 1.0 (9/03/20): Created a README.txt and added FiveM/SP Installation Instructions/files--

Thanks for downloading my mod :D

In the folder you will find both a FiveM version (resource) and an SP version (dlc.rpf).

-----[FiveM Installation]-----
1. Drag and drop the folder inside the FiveM folder into your resources folder for the FiveM server
2. Add "start blackrose" to your server.cfg
3. Start your server and enjoy the mod!!!

-----[SinglePlayer Installation]-----
1. Open the SP folder for the download and locate the "blackrose" folder.
2. Locate your GTA5 Installation folder, and navigate to "mods/update/x64/dlcpacks" then drag "blackrose" in there. (if they don't exist, create those folders)
3. Open up OpenIV*** and navigate to mods/update/update.rpf/data and then click edit mode at the top in OpenIV and edit "dlclist.xml"

NOTE: If you don't have an update.rpf there, go to the regular update.rpf at "update/update.rpf" then toggle edit mode at the top of OpenIV, and it will warn you you are not in the mods folder. You will then click copy to mods folder and then navigate to "mods/update/update.rpf/data" to edit "dlclist.xml" once it finishes. DO NOT EDIT THE FILE OUTSIDE THE MODS FOLDER, YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!

4. Go to the last line that ends in "</Item>" and start a new line. Put the following on the new line and then save the file:
"<Item>dlcpacks:/blackrose/</Item>"
5. That's it!! Enjoy

***If you don't know what this is I suggest you do some reading before continuing with this as you could corrupt your GTA5 installation. 



Again thanks for choosing my mod!!! :D
